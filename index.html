    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <h3>IaaS Administrator, Rakuten ◆  Apr 2015 - Oct 2017</h3>
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    Manage, administer vSphere-based IaaS (25000+ VMs, 900+ servers). Plan, execute deployment and allocation of
    servers according to dynamically-changing resource requirements. Manage software, driver versions by
    determining optimal version and implementing it. Support internal users by troubleshooting latency issues,
    managing access privileges and other general usage queries. Troubleshoot, resolve vSphere configuration and
    installation issues. Write, review scripts to automate operations and check for configuration consistency.
    Handle alerts.
    <h4>Key Achievements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Due to rack limitations, provisioning of new servers had to be stopped for 6 months. Through careful
            planning and calculation, I was able to accommodate the continuous creation of new VMs by optimizing
            server allocation between existing clusters.
        </li>
        <li>Single-handedly planned for and executed the upgrade-cum-migration of our Windows-based vCenter
            environment to Linux-based while cleaning up legacy network configurations. This resulted in higher
            stability and ease of management with reduced man-hours spent on vCenter troubleshooting (~1day every
            2 wks → 1,2 hrs every mth).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>IaaS Administrator+Improver, Rakuten  ◆  Nov 2017 - Oct 2018</h3>
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    Same as above but less administration/operations, more improvement-focused. Investigate, plan and execute ideas
    to improve stability, manageability and reduce operation time. Manage weekly system improvement meeting to
    coordinate, discuss improvement tasks. Communicate, collaborate with and transfer knowledge to offshore team.
    <h4>Key Achievements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Overhauled entire ESXi server configuration process by implementing Configuration as Code (CaC). Done
            by building on open-source tool while adding unique features to fit system design. Configuration of
            servers is structured and output is clear and reliable, resulting in easy maintenance and possible
            automation of higher level processes.
        </li>
        <li>Implemented a set of scripts for taking an ESXi server in/out of service, and for doing a coordinated
            rolling upgrade of the OS, drivers and firmware of ESXi server, by utilizing the aforementioned CaC.
            As a result, efficiency of man-hours spent on rolling upgrades improved dramatically (4-6 servers in
            1 day → max of 47 servers in 1 day) while reducing possible human errors to near-zero.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cloud Infrastructure Engineer, Rakuten  ◆  Nov 2018 - Jan 2020</h3>
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    Switched role to become a junior developer on new OSS-based Baremetal-As-A-Service. Read, review code and fix
    minor bugs while understanding frameworks used, process flow from code to deployment and overall architecture.
    Design and implement features by working on API endpoints, external tools and DAO-based database access.
    Manage and update infrastructure with Chef. Organize user documentation. Facilitate scrum events for team.
    <h4>Key Achievements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented a new and improved way of how server IPMI commands are accessed by the system
            and managed by administrators. Done by moving the commands out from application code and into a JSON
            file. Also isolated common commands from manufacturer/model specific ones, then arranged them in a
            hierarchical format (common -> manufacturer-specific -> model-specific). This greatly reduced
            overlapping code, eliminated the need to recompile and redeploy the application due to changes in IPMI
            commands, and improved manageability of IPMI commands.
        </li>
    </ul>
